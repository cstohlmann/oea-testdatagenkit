# Notebooks

This includes the original python scripts developed by Jordyn, and elevated to OEA compatibility by Christian.

Notebooks ending in "...\_py" are class notebooks defining functions/methods used in their respective "...\_demo" notebooks.

These notebooks also require the same requirement script attached to a spark pool.
